Business Strategy 
This project was created to inform women in the Cardiff area of a female only gym which will be opening. It’s purpose it to inform the user on what the gym has to offer, sign up to updates, contact the gym and find it’s location. 

Scope 

The user will be able to view all the information necessary on the gym’s equipments, classes, and trainers. If the user is interested in joining the gym or getting further updates they can sign up to receive emails. The user will also have our contact tel and email to contact the gym if need be. 


Structure 

One page multi section giving all the information is an informative and linear flow leading to the main objective, the sign up. When first visiting the page you're greeted by our hero image, followed by the contained title (Ladies Fitness Cardiff), and a call to action button to sign up. This also include a standard header bar for the four sections; amenities, packages, personal trainers, and sign up. The header compacts down into a burger menu with lower media screens to prevent a chunky header. Below the hero image is the "A safe space for women to workout" section, this gives a brief description of the gym and it's future amenities. Amenities is the next section which currently lists the four main sections of the gym. Below shows our personal trainers cards which includes; their images, names, and speciality. Packages follows which outlines the prices, inclusion, followed by a call to action sign up button. THen the Cardiff Map for location and the sign up sheet. The sign upsheet requires all sections tobe filled out before submit button can be selected. Below then is my basic footer including links to the sections above, copyright, and a notice advising this is strictly for educational purposes only. 


Skeleton 

For the skeleton design I used Balsamiq Wireframes. This allowed me to plan and envision my mobile and desktop design before beginning to code.

Would Ideally love to have the site as a multi page application, but with time constraints and issues with content as the company is new with very few resources it was difficult to make the multipage app without meaningful content.
